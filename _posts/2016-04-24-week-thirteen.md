On the topic of CS371P.

Core Questions:

1. What did you do this past week?

The schedule for this past week made me feel a bit hopeless, but finishing the assignments and the project didn't seem so bad at all. I don't know if the school work is easier than they usually are, but I managed to finish all of my assignments and projects on time this week. The majority of this week was spent going over the remaining details of how to properly construct and destruct children of abstract classes and finishing the Life project. Downing even went over several key points on how to extensively create multiple versions of abstract classes if there needs to be a distinction between abstract child branches. As for project Life, my partner and I managed to meet up almost everyday to get parts of the project done, so by the time the project was due, it was a breeze to finish (even though the deadline was extended by one day).

2. What is in your way?

Nothing was really in my way this week. My partner and I found the time and gave the needed effort to successfully accomplish our project. Although the project went smoothly, I am still not so prepared for the test in a few weeks. This week has been perfectly busy and productive, but I wish I was a little less lazy so I could have started studying for the test.

3. What will you do next week?

I hope to spend a good amount of time studying for the test and finishing the remaining readings. This final test is my final redemption to keep my grade as a B, as its currently in the C range (didn't do so hot on the first test with the whole Canvas test environment).

My experiences with CS371P this week:

This week's lectures were extremely helpful in guiding my partner and I in project Life's development. While most of the lecture content was already implemented in our project, there were quite a few pieces of advice that we didn't catch until this week. My experience with OOP this week was mostly encouraging but also a great growing experience in the exposure to me on the abstraction of classes and their heirarchies. 

My reactions to CS371P material this week:

I had a ton of fun. This project was another game development/cell automata based platform, which for me is an exciting topic to fool around with. I was surprised to see the effects and usefulness of abstract classes despite how bare bone the abstract classes appear.

Tip of the Week:

If you ever want to learn how to be a full stack engineer, freecodecamp.com will give you a full stack engineer certificate if you complete all of their modules (supposedly it takes around 2048 hours to complete). Learning the tools and skills of a full stack engineer has great benefits in equipping you for backend, middleware, and front end development, and has a great demand out in the job market.
