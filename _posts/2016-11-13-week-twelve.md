On the topic of CS373.

Core Questions:

~~ What did you do this past week? ~~

I spent the majority of last week working on completing any of the unfinished requirements from the previous project phase as well as the current project phase, attending class lectures, and finishing the reading assignments. In particular, my group and I pursued to fix several bugs plaguing our project from the last phase, and I've been spending a great deal of time trying to find a way to implement the search API in our project. It'll be interesting to see how we can get the search working with our current set up with flask restless.


~~ What is in your way? ~~

Right now, I think perhaps the motivation is missing, which can be a large barrier to being more productive. The way our project is structured worries me a lot, and honestly, was not at all what was envisioned in the first place. Obviously, the current setup is a shortcut to accomplishing what we needed to last phase, but with a huge cut to flexibility. With constant bugs and barriers in flexibility, its just very unmotivating. 



~~ What will you do next week? ~~

Next week will be primarily focused on finishing the final project phase. We have to not only finalize our project product, but create a presentation and critique another group's product. I don't really see my time going to anything other than class and finishing this project. 



~~ My experiences with CS373 this week: ~~

Since there was nothing due this week for SWE, it was definitely a relaxing week. It was interesting reviewing the refactoring approaches that were discussed in the assigned readings. Some of the questions on the quizzes were interesting this week and last week too... Really, the quizzes were interesting because I felt the questions were poorly written, but that's my own opinion. The refactoring discussions we've been having this week have been extremely helpful though.



~~ My reactions to CS373 material this week: ~~

I haven't been too shocked or overwhelmed by the material this week. Refactoring is an interesting topic, but it leaves little to anything other than the common sense of programmers. If you have the time to clean up your code, of course, the approaches Downing spoke on seemed to be general rules of thumb. Any way, I've always been more interested in the programming language behaviors and why they behave certain ways. 



~~ Tip of the Week: ~~

If you are ever interested in designing an android app with augmented reality, its remarkably easier to do get started than you would think. For android, you're not only allowed to access the camera, but you can customize how the camera is displayed or used. Using the camera library (from the hardware package), you can overlay a surface view over the displayed camera in order to add images or render objects over the camera. Also, you can detect direction from the compass library (of Google Maps API, which ever library you'd prefer to use), which can assist with updating the location or appearance of the surface view objects displayed over the camera (meaning removing or shifting the images off the screen). Augmented reality is very much of a practical thing to do.
