On the topic of CS371P.

Core Questions:

1. What did you do this past week?

This past week was very relaxing, where there wasn't a single assignment due, a test to take, or a project to finish. I spent the majority of this week reviewing and working on the project that is due next week, Life, as well as go to lecture to learn about parent to child inheritance, and the applications of abstract base classes have on their children. Essentially, the object oriented programming part of my week was not so busy, only some lecture attendance, book readings, and planning/starting the Life project. Guessing from the last project and reviews from previous years about Life, I'll be living in the GDC basement for the next week.

2. What is in your way?

As a co-founder of the organization Need2Austin, we partnered with 3 other organizations to do a big concert called a Jam Scramble, I'm a part of the board to obtaining the equipment and arranging the materials for the concert to successfully take place. The preparation of the concert was not the only obstacle that absorbed my time, but also the event itself took all of my Thursday away from me, a core day that I spend working on OOP material. Also being a part of the christian organizations has taken a piece of my time out too. With these organizational obligations, OOP became a far fetched dream that I couldn't quite find enough time.

3. What will you do next week?

Next week, doesn't look too pretty. With the two big assignments and the Life project, I'll be lucky if I have any time to read the OOP material. While it looks like we'll be expanding on abstraction and inheritance, hopefully the lectures will give more insight on the tools we need to know to successfully finish the Life project. 

My experiences with CS371P this week:

I had fun learning about the next project and about abstraction. It was really odd to hear about the applications and uses of abstract classes, but it eventually made more sense when we began planning out Life. My overall experience was good and productive, but it was a little more laid back than my usual experiences. The topics downing went over weren't difficult at all and the project has been too difficult yet, which is a good sign.

My reactions to CS371P material this week:

I was pleased that more of the lectures this week were geared to help us on the Life project. Although the material isn't as exciting as last week, I was enjoying the lectures and the topics thoroughly. 

Tip of the Week:

Whenever you program, please be sure to spread out the project work across the time frame you have to work on it. If you do it the night before, you'll lose the opportunities to sleep over what kind of work you've done and/or think over the problems you ran into. Committing only an hour or two a day is totally enough to get a project done on time with quality work. You'll be surprised how much less code you'll end up using and how much more precise and correct your algorithms will be.
