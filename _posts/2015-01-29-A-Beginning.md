On the topic of CS371P:

TLDR

1. What did you do this past week?

I attempted to read all of the class material on time, but alas, I feel unconfident about the amount information I'm retaining from the text.

2. What is in your way?

The other classes I'm taking are not project intensive, but reading intensive. These other reading assignments are blocking the interest I have in diving deep into the topics of Object Oriented programming.

3. What will you do next week?

I will spread out the reading assignments of the classes so they don't collide with each other.


Reading assignments have never really had a place in my heart, but the literature that I've been going through for the classes this semester have been absolutely exciting. From security, to complex algorithms, and to Object Oriented Programming, the content seems to be exciting and with each passing minute, the material shows to be extraodinarily important to my career. Other than the reading assignments, I've only spent a few hours on starting the Object Oriented Project 1, but it hasn't made a huge amount of progress. The grand total of time spent on the Object Oriented Programming class is heavily dominated by the weight pressed on the reading assignments.

With so much value in the passages assigned, the knowledge seems to be alluring, but the total amount of substance is a bit overwhelming. I can feel my head growing more and more condensed, but I hope that it'll ease in the future. I've spent quite a few hours dedicated to understanding the content of An Introduction to Object Oriented Programming, and I'm still profusely struggling.

The only solution I can think of that can revive my fascination in the reading assignments is to spread out the reading tasks to different times of the day. With the room to breathe and think over the text that is read, the time given between each reading should help enhance my capabilty to comprehend the material better. I hope it'll also help with the efficiency between reading and retaining the matter of the topics read. 

Integrating this new strategy may be tough for this upcoming week, because of all of the different events taking place (College of Natural Science Technical Career Fair and Organization meetings). One of my goals for this upcoming week is to manage the time and effort to try this action plan.
