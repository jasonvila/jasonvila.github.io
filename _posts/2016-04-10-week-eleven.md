On the topic of CS371P.

Core Questions:

1. What did you do this past week?

This past week we dove fairly deep into how the vector datastructure is implemented. Downing's lectures gave a great deal of detail to the functionality and purposes of how vector was developed. Even certain optimizations were suggested, that helped prevent redundant and vulnerable code. My freetime was mostly spent working on the Darwin project. Even though the project seemed adequately easy, the actual solution to the project was a total nightmare. Many of the other students probably found the project easy, but it was certainly a challenge for me. Even though the project was strenuous in all sorts of ways, the project showed its colors in positive ways. Darwin took to be one of the more fun projects, where I learned more about abstraction and the basis of game development than I have ever before. I would definitely do again.

2. What is in your way?

Except for a Algorithms test and a Network Security and Privacy project being due, there wasn't a lot in my way. The test and project didn't take a great deal of my time, and so what remained to be the biggest obstacle of all turned out to be finding a project implementation of Darwin that my partner and I would agree on. While my partner and I conflicted in our own preferred implementations, the rewriting of the code base took dozens of more hours of my time than it should have.

3. What will you do next week?

This next week will likely be very relaxing. It turns out that I don't have a single assignment, project, or test due the next week. So attending class and doing the readings is the only possible thing OOP related that will be keeping me busy. Other than school, I'm leading a 6 hour concert event at Greg that involves around 4 music organizations, so that'll absorb a ton of my time too. Hopefully getting started in Project 5 Life will be a core topic of interest for me next week, since I hear its even worse than Darwin... Which can be scary but sounds like it'll be another trial that'll thoroughly enjoy.

My experiences with CS371P this week:

This week was a little feverish with stressing on the Darwin project. As exciting as learning about vectors are, my thoughts on Darwin took out alittle bit of the joy I could've experienced this week. It was mostly good experiences though, where I felt I was extremely productive. The thing about Darwin wasn't even the bugs, for they only took moments to fix, but the size of the code base that had to be written. So what was my experience this week? It was like a downhill rollercoaster, where every turn looked like it could be alittle more frightening, but truly was the time of my life. 

My reactions to CS371P material this week:

I really enjoyed the material this week! Even though Vector is a complex datastructre structure to learn about, Downing does a great job in ensuring the students understanding the inner and outer structure of Vector. I was very surprised to see the strategies Vector uses to reduce redundancy and increase the security of Vector, but my reactions mostly pertained to feeling more confident in using Vector in a practical and professional way. 

Tip of the Week:

When you are pair programming, its very important to ensure that you and your partner agree on a software design from the start. If y'all decide it mid way through the implementation, it will be even harder to agree on a working solution than before. I understand that a lot of the code may not be something you can predictably work on both being satisfied on, but its important that you try to cover all the bases as soon as you get the project description. It may very well save you dozens of hours of refactoring code.
