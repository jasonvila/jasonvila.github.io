On the topic of CS373.

Core Questions:

~~ What did you do this past week? ~~

This past week composed of more work than I expected or I probably should have done. With several assignments and projects due, I hardly even managed to get half of the SWE readings out of the way. With having to optimize Collatz, write two android apps, vector calc and crypto homework, I felt extremely overwhelmed. Even so, that the stress was causing my throat to swell more (I've had a sore throat since Monday). I guess for the most part, I spent the majority of last week stressing out, but it all worked out in the end.



~~ What is in your way? ~~

Some of the obstacles in my way are organization commitments, sore throat (turns out it was an ulcer on my uvula, that's probably what I get for eating extremely hot food), and of course, eating and sleeping... Too bad I actually need to eat and sleep, or else I would be so much more productive. Although these may seem like barriers to helping more acadmic performance, reallistically, they're probably helping me stay motivated in my school work (except for the sore throat).



~~ What will you do next week? ~~

Next week, I'll be attending class, studying for the first midterm, finishing the readings (especially extreme programming installed), and showing up to my organization meetings (missed a couple last week). Hopefully, I'll get a partner and get started on project 2, I really don't like staying up late finishing up a procrastinated project.



~~ My experiences with CS373 this week: ~~

It was a fun, but a little less enjoyable than usual because of being slightly sick and the late nights. I'll need to work on my time management a little bit... but my experiences were mostly positive. I was slightly frustrated with Sphere and myself for the amount of time wasted in getting SphereCollatz.py to pass. Lesson learned for sure.



~~ My reactions to CS373 material this week: ~~

The lectures this week are still close to identical to the OOP lectures from last semester, but it was interesting to learn some of the underlying exceptions and behaviors of Python. It seems like Tuples, Lists, Dictionaries, and Sets will be fundamentally useful in my future projects in a variety of ways. I've always been mostly fascinated with Python Dictionaries, but never knew the different established rules on dictionaries as well as tuples, lists, and sets. Looks like these internal data structures will have a lot of weird future behavior.



~~ Tip of the Week: ~~

When you're sick, coughing, annoyed, angry, stressed, or just have a common cold, don't push yourself too hard on the projects. They may very well hurt you or even worse, send you to the hospital. Naturally homework induces healthy and unhealthy stress, but not over consuming the unhealthy stress is partially the key to suviving college... Just don't let it get the best of you. You know, there is some irony in this whole "work/life style". We overwork so that we can afford to take care of ourselves, but its the very same work that makes taking care of ourselves too expensive.
