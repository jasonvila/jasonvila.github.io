On the topic of CS371P.

Core Questions:

1. What did you do this past week?

This last week's effort and time mostly pertained to winding down in the Object Oriented Programming material and trying to survive the overwhelming amount of work/tests from the other classes. In terms of the work actually done for this class, I ended up just doing the readings, getting started on the projects, and attending the lectures. PLanning for the project that is due after Spring Break was a huge priority this week, as there will be no time for me to really work on the Allocator project until I get back from my Spring Break vacation. 

2. What is in your way?

This past week was swamped with several tests, assignments, and a project that each required at least 10 to 35 hours of work. The ridiculous amount of time demanded for this following week became a huge obstacle in me being completely and wholesomely dedicated to doing well in planning the project for the upcoming project due date.

3. What will you do next week?

Next week I'll be out of town on my spring break. It'll be very tough to keep up with finishing the project before its due date, but definitely not possible. It looks like there is nothing that is needed to be read or done but the project assignment, so that'll be my main focus for object oriented programming this week.


My experiences with CS371P this week:

This week's experiences were mostly good experiences where I was excited to learn about the upcoming project and the content the speaker gave a talk on. Project Allocator looks like it'll be a fun memory allocation project that'll require a lot of thought but definitely a good amount of growth. The class time and project preparation has me excited but my experiences hasnt been a lot of growth, just good preparation for growth to happen.


My reactions to CS371P material this week:

My reactions this week were mostly with excitement, but that could probably be because of the upcoming Spring Break that was happening this next week. The Allocator project details kept my attention, so it was interesting and reminded me a lot of CS439 Operating Systems. The lecture given by the guest also caught my attention, where I felt he gave a lot of great advise and good points in the professional world of programming.


Tip of the Week:

Be careful about super cookies in your devices. It turns out that the manufacturers can put in super cookies in your devices that they create which cannot be removed. Because of this, they can track everything and anything you do. There has been a push to force manufacturers to remove them, but they are yet to be removed. So whatever you browse or do, make sure its done carefully or on devices that contain no super cookies.
