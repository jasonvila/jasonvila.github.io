On the topic of CS371P.

Core Questions:

1. What did you do this past week?

This past week was full of rest and none OOP related activities. As the students don't have class during Spring Break, there was still a Object Oriented Programming project that is the week following Spring Break. It seems that there might be a mob that'll rise up to fight the tyranny of professors utilizing the Spring Break period for projects, but I don't really mind. I spent a hour or two this week working on the Allocator Project, getting all the initial files and set up done. Other than that, there didn't seem to be any OOP related activities on my end.

2. What is in your way?

This time Spring Break was in my way. I was enjoying myself so much that I forgot where I was or what was due the following week. The enjoyment wasn't so much the fun as the rest and comfort of being away from the school work. Its nice to have a break and it certainly got in my way of accomplishing any OOP objectives. Although it seems like its in the way of my productivitiy in this class this week, the rest is definitely going to be a great investment for future assignments, as the tiredness won't weigh me down so much.

3. What will you do next week?

This next week, I'll be finishing the Allocator OOP project and working on the readings. Even though I have started the project, there is still so much to do this week. I'll have to meet up with my partner to ensure that the project is successfully completed. Also, getting back in the rhythm will be a key player to my performance in OOP.


My experiences with CS371P this week:

There wasn't a single experience to reflect on, just a feeling of comfort and relaxation. With no class lectures.


My reactions to CS371P material this week:

There was no material to react to, only the satisfaction of rest.


Tip of the Week:

When it comes to programming, always ensure to get some rest and relaxation. If you stress yourself too much on solving a problem, you can easily burn yourself out and even waste hours of your time. Getting periods of rest in between each session of work is essential to your performance and your health. You'll think faster on your feet, and you'll feel more confident with the solutions you implement. As always, don't let the sleep get the best of you, be sure to wake up and finish your work, or else the rest won't be worth its time.
