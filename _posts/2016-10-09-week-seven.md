On the topic of CS373.

Core Questions:

~~ What did you do this past week? ~~

This past week was filled with test reviews and class lectures. Since the reading material wasn't going to be on the test, it seemed acceptable to me that I spend more of my time reviewing the semantics and behaviors of Python from previous lectures, projects, and notes. The reading material deemed to still be important for my understanding of the concept of designing software efficiently and understanding the languages more suitably.



~~ What is in your way? ~~

I was swamped with an Android App project and with Rachel coming in town, my time quickly disappeared. Its amazing how much time a small app or even a person's visit can consume. The android app eventually became a small obstacle that wasn't hindering my success in reviewing the needed material for the test, but Rachel's visit surely took up the saved time that wasn't spent on the App.



~~ What will you do next week? ~~

Next week will primarily be beginning the new project, organizing the new team, attending lecture, and continuing to finish the readings. While the project doesn't seem entirely too challenging, I know it will be time consuming (especially the writing flag portion). Kick starting the project itself will perhaps be the most difficult part, and hopefully my team will work well in ensuring the kick start happens quickly.



~~ My experiences with CS373 this week: ~~

This week was rather tense and stressful, but definitely worth the experience. I learned a lot about packing, unpacking, and Range Iterator. I know developing iterators are critically important to software engineering (really very basic too), but the packing and unpacking was the most useful material for me to find out. I've always been curious as to how many of the languages took care of variadic functions, and this really makes sense to me.



~~ My reactions to CS373 material this week: ~~

My reaction to the material this week is, as always, inspired and motivated to learn more in depth the underlying reasons and behaviors of the new material presented. This week we spoke on more on iterators, packing and unpacking parameter variables, and I was seriously surprised on how packing and unpacking works.



~~ Tip of the Week: ~~

When ever you want to use a function that is memory or time intensive, its important to always invoke this function on a separate thread from the main. While it may be helpful to use a new thread for the time/memory intensive function, its also very dangerous (with race conditions). One way to avoid race conditions all together is to use prewritten data structures that have synchronization already built in, or to use specifically asynchronous threading. Asynchronous threading provides the programmer the ability to not have to worry about race conditions but have the full benefits (minus a few) of multithreading.
