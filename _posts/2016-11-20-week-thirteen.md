On the topic of CS373.

Core Questions:

~~ What did you do this past week? ~~

Our final SWE project was due last Thursday. While the project was less demanding than the previous ones, my group still had several issues and bugs to resolve. Much of last week was spent polishing and finishing the final requirements of the project (especially since we were expected to present it). The free time I had, aside the time spent on the project, was used to stay on top of the readings and attend lectures. Much to my surprise, I didn't have as much free time for the readings and lectures due to a sinus infection. Hopefully next week's break will help regenerate my health.


~~ What is in your way? ~~

Last week was hard pressed for time (since most of my classes were rushing to finish assignments before Thanksgiving). Also, I was sick for the later helf of the week, really just a sinus infection, but the illness put me out of work for several days. I needed those days to improve the project and finish other assignments, but I realized I needed rest more than anything.


~~ What will you do next week? ~~

Next week will be a extremely short week. In terms of this class, perhaps just attend Monday lecture, do any of the remaining readings, study a little bit for the test, and finish the final requirements of the project (the presentation, critiques, and visualization). I think for the most part, next week will be spent ensuring that the visualization works.


~~ My experiences with CS373 this week: ~~

My experiences were not entirely exciting. Downing spoke on several important topics that are critical to software engineering (dynamic binding, interfaces, singleton design), but again, its been mostly review for me. A lot of modern full stack programming utilizes these techniques, so experiencing Downing's lectures and the real world demand for this kind of programming just helps solidify my understanding of these topics.


~~ My reactions to CS373 material this week: ~~

I wasn't exactly ecstatic to learn or review the material Downing went over in lecture, but it has been very helpful to be reminded of these topics. I was slightly happy to finally hear Downing speak on these topics, but I think he spoke on them really too late in the game. He should've gone more in depth on the singleton design and dynamic binding before our second project phase.


~~ Tip of the Week: ~~

If you are ever having trouble testing a Android app on a emulated device, perhaps you'll want to try GenyMotion. GenyMotion provides the most realistic Android emulators (using virtual box) to help the programmers with testing their apps on the variety of architectures, without heavy expenses. Of course, if you are trying to develop for augmented reality (which involves gps and the camera), GenyMotion can only provide you some, but not all of the functionality you're looking for. You have to manually change the directions, bearings, and gps if you want to test gps tracking. Also, the camera doesn't always work (most of the time it does though). Lastly, the best part is that you can try it (for however long you want) for free!
