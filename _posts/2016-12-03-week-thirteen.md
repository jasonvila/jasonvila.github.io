On the topic of CS373.

Core Questions:

~~ What did you do this past week? ~~

The last week of school has always been, traditionally, a mess. Its really that time of year where the professors desparately attempt to finish up the school year. I didn't necessarily make it sound terrible, but its much worse than it sounds. Contrary to this tradition, Professor Downing was very kind to keep this week to project presentations and the final SWE test. Most of the material for the SWE test was managable, and the presentations were (as expected) the best part of the class, where the teams show off their final product. Essentially, this week consisted of mostly studying for the test and preparing for our project presentation.


~~ What is in your way? ~~

Other than the need to sleep and other class obligations, I suppose a lack of confidence, energy, and time. I wasn't sure if I would have enough time to study for the SWE test and prepare for the SWE final project presentation. Fortunately, I put a lot of effort during the Thanksgiving break to keep myself from falling behind in SWE. 


~~ What will you do next week? ~~

Next week? I don't think there is anything left next week other than this blog. I finished all of the other extra credit and I gave everything I could to finish strong in this class. I suppose this next week will be me anticipating my final grade in this class.


~~ My experiences with CS373 this week: ~~

This week was not as terribly rushed as I was expecting it to be. The experiences this week mostly consisted of be awed by other group projects and immense stress over finalizing the finishing touches of my team's project. Overall, this week has been fascinating and worthwhile. I learned a great deal about the other team's approaches and the different critiques that certainly would have been game changers for our project. 


~~ My reactions to CS373 material this week: ~~

Instead of being surprised by Downing, I was surprised by the beauty and strategy of the other students final products. They did such an elegant job of maintaining efficient backend and frontend communication, while maintaining great UX. Most of the other material in this class was primarily a review for the test this week, so I experienced no surprises there. The material this week has been comfortable and reaffirming.


~~ Tip of the Week: ~~

If you are ever designing an encryption or signing scheme, always use conventional and published schemes. You'll most likely make your entire system more vulnerable if you make shift an encryption/signing scheme from different published schemes. One example of this is the iMessage. It turns out that any attacker can forge a signature or decrypt a iMessage in 2^28 queries (which would probably take you 3 days, but the real issue is that it can be done in polynomial time). This vulnerability is due to iMessage trying to make shift their own encryption scheme combining multiple techniques, which ended up backfiring. 


~ Overall CS373 Experience: ~

My experience with CS373 SWE was fun and interesting. The time commitment was not nearly as terrible as some of the other courses I've taken, but the amount of material covered met the criteria of many of these other courses. The tests tested my knowledge very well, the projects practiced and tested my pair programming/communication skills, the readings presented an amass of new material, and the lectures revealed a variety of behaviors and techniques. 

I spent the first half of this semester working in individual and small group projects. These projects were small code bases, but consisted of a great amount of thought and effort. Optimizations and code clarity were the key to ensuring successful project development practices.

The second semester was mostly spent on contributing to a team based project. My team mates and I spent a great deal of time establishing camaraderie and efficient backend and front end services. While our professionalism and experiences didn't amount enough to making our project easy, the way my team handled the challenges helped give me assurance that my team mates were well equipped for the challenges we faced.

The course was fun, informative, interesting, stressful, relaxing, dramatic, and kept my attention the entire way through. Professor Downing did a great job teaching this course.
