On the topic of CS371P.

Core Questions:

1. What did you do this past week?

This past week was the calm before the storm. Only one assignment was due this past week, and it wasn't even in OOP. The problem is, however, that I have 3 tests, 2 assignments, and a essay due next week. So like I said, its the calm before the storm. I spent the majority of the OOP related time to studying for the final test. I need a heck of a good grade on this test if I plan on making sure I keep my B. Luckily downing doesn't do the +/- system, but it can be very dramatic to my GPA if I were to drop even a fraction of a point below the 800 points I need. I've also been spending sometime ensuring that my portfolio on Seelio is completed, I really need those extra points to ensure the grade I want too.

2. What is in your way?

I have other tests, assignments, and an essay that I've been busy with, so sacrificing some of that time for to studying for the OOP test just hasn't been very practical for me. I hope I can find the motivation to seriously sit down and understand all the material I need to know. I'll probably join a couple of study groups to optimize the productivity of my studying.  

3. What will you do next week?

Next week I'll be semi-zombie and semi-asleep. I don't think I'll be altogether anywhere. I just hope I make it out of hell week with all of my toes and fingers. I do plan on studying a good amount for this final OOP test. Its awesome we don't have a final, but it is a little dramatic that this is my final opportunity.

My experiences with CS371P this week:

This week was a little boring, but still useful. My experience with the in class lectures was that I felt more confident on what a handle was (our last project had one and I was so confused as to what its purpose was), but the remainder of the material seemed to be a little less important as prepping for the final test deemed to be even more important at the time. Although it was a little boring, finish the seelio was fun. Seelio may not be Object Oriented programming related, but it was related to the bonus for this class. It may very well be my life saver.

My reactions to CS371P material this week:

I was a bit fond of the topic on handlers in OOP, but my reactions were a bit dull in regards to the material this week. I'm ready for a break, its been a very busy semester. My core reaction was happy and confident on the handlers topic, but distracted on the fact that the test is coming up.

Tip of the Week:

If you are looking for a forum of online free classes, here is a great post on Reddit that lists around 156 of them: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3fvz78/heres_a_list_of_156_free_online_programmingcs/

I personally Love the introduction to databases from Stanford, it gave me a great overview on the how to and importance of implement databases in the right way (with parsers).
