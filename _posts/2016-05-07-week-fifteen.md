On the topic of CS371P.

Core Questions:

1. What did you do this past week?

As always, hell week is a nightmare. It wasn't so bad for OOP, but the collective amount of stress and responsibility from my other classes made this week rather busy. For oop, I spent the majority of the time studying for Test 2 and attending the lectures. While it doesn't seem like I did a lot, the quantity of content for Test 2 is very large. Test 2 included material from projects 3 through 5 and every lecture since Spring Break (about 6 weeks worth of material). The lectures this week were interesting, finishing up the details of how to make vector adaptable to user defined allocators and how to make a good handler class.

2. What is in your way?

The other courses I'm taking are really taking a lot of my energy and time. Its interesting how much work each course can throw at you at the last second. What is even more fascinating is how desparate some of the professors are in ensuring that all of the material is covered. Its all right though, the last bit of material from all of my classes seemed to be very important and useful. If only I had more time and energy to focus on OOP instead of these other classes...

3. What will you do next week?

We don't have anymore lectures or classes after last Friday, and because of this, we don't have anymore OOP material to go over. In addition to this, our last test (we don't have a final) was last Friday, so it looks like we're done in terms of the OOP course. This doesn't mean I won't be trying to program anything in a OOP mindset anytime soon. Perhaps this next week I'll experiment a bit with developing some sort of game. We'll see, but I do plan on imporoving my public github profile. It looks a little bit barren even with how much I use git.

My experiences with CS371P this week:

This week was dreadful, but useful. The lectures were especially useful in explaining the importance and the purpose between handle1, handle2, and handle3 classes. I feel like making vector adaptable to allow user defined allocators could have been a bit self explanatory, but it was still useful to hear why and how it works from Downing. My experiences with Test 2 was like the Titanic. I felt confident about the material I knew and had spent at least a dozen hours studying for the test, but the test was like a unforeseen iceberg. It probably would be a better description if it was some random rogue wave hitting my cruise. Any way, I felt that all the material from OOP was nearly useless on that test. Test 2 definitely didn't feel like it tested anymore than 10% of my knowledge of OOP. The test appeared to be a tad long, especially since we had 5 coding questions for 50 minutes we were testing for. Not a single multiple choice question... not even a short answer. It was a disappointing test.

My reactions to CS371P material this week:

The material was fascinating. The optimizations for the handlers that Downing described could cut out so many computational steps that were unnecessary. In fact, his implementation looked just like a fancy proxy that helped cut out space and time use. The optimizations for the vector was interesting too, but adding the flexibility with the allocator didn't seem too important. Maybe I'll need it sometime in the future.

Tip of the Week:

If you are a programmer but you have never heard of P and NP problems, you should probably learn about how to utilize, identify, and solve these problems. In the real world industry, NP problems will be a common obstacle, and knowing how to use, identify, and solve NP problems in polynomial time could save you hundreds of hours. Also, if you so happen to solve a NP-complete problem in polynomial time, please tell the world. You may have just solved cancer.
