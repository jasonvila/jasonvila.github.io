On the topic of CS373.

Core Questions:

~~ What did you do this past week? ~~

In terms of SWE, the majority of my energy and time went towards the readings, preparing for the test, and attending class. We have the test that's coming up next Thursday, and really, I'm not very sure if I should be extremely intimidated or not. I'll probably be fine with how much time I've spent with the projects and SWE material so far though.



~~ What is in your way? ~~

As always, I have a lot of organizational commitments as well as several projects due this week. Of course if I didn't need sleep, it would be easier to take care of all of the reading assignments and material at ease. I think this week was handled fairly well, so I wouldn't really consider any of my outside commitments to be jeopardizing my performance in SWE.



~~ What will you do next week? ~~

Next week will be very rough... but I'll surely be able to finish all the assignments and prepare for the test. Even though attending class lectures are important this week, preparing for the upcoming test will be the primary focus. Catching up on the reading assignments that I missed may be the third highest priority for this week, but I'm not entirely sure how much time I'll be able to put in to the readings this week.
