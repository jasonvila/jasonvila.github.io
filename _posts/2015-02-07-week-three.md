On the topic of CS371P.

Core Questions:

1. What did you do this past week?

This past week was definitely more of a relief than the week before. With no projects, one assignment, and zero tests, the week cruised along just fine. I did experience a lot of difficulty trying to find a good time to meet with my partner, but it seemed to workout every other day. My partner and I did end up starting project 2, Voting, and we got more stuck on how to receive and store the input than how to implement the algorithm for processing the data given. In retrospect, it didn't take much time to understand how to parse and receive the input, it only took a little bit of research in the methods we were allowed to use. Also deciding on the object structure to use for each election was a core piece of our program. 

2. What is in your way?

There wasn't much in my way, but I did struggle with getting the readings done, as always. It seems like I keep getting farther and farther behind in the content I need to read over. This will end up being a nightmare if I don't fix this issue soon. Time isn't necessarily the issue too, since I do have a little each day, but the primary issue are my priorities. I've been getting more and more involved in my organizations, and dedicated less time to the development of my professional/academic career. Even though I gave up several personal projects to enhance my productivity on my homework, its still a sacrifice out of my professional development. 

3. What will you do next week?

Next week will be a hellish of a time. I'll need to make sure to get my homework, projects, assignments, and readings done on time. Everything is sort of condensed on this one week, where everything is due this week and the remaining weeks are absolutely calm. The thing is that it isn't a lot of work, but I have a dedication to the Noblemen group in the Navigators to spend next week living with a dozen or two brothers in christ. It might be tough being sure to find the time to spend with my brothers as well as in get all the work I need done. I'm doing my best to get as much done as possible the weekend of February 12th. We'll see how things go. 


My experiences with CS371P this week:

It was not that much of a surprising week, as there was a speaker for one of the days just going over his experiences at main street hub. He seems like a good guy and it was a cool presentation, but I honestly would rather spend more time on the material Downing goes over than what the speaker was focused on expressing to the class. The other material was somewhat shocking, one of which was the template <typedef variable>. I didnt realize that c++ provided this ability for the method/function parameters. Although it can be a dangerous object to use, it is so useful for handling various different types of parameters objects. Really, its brilliant.

My reactions to CS371P material this week:

I was a bit bored with the lecture given by the speaker, even though it was semi useful. The other material seriously persuaded me to continue research the depth and abilities of c++ in object oriented programming. 

Tip of the Week:

When you're using the internet on your router, make sure to change the password for the router admin settings page. Believe it or not, a website could run a simple script on your computer exposing the ip address of your router and login to the router settings. They could even manipulate the dns table of the router without you knowing, which can be very dangerous. My tip is to becareful when searching for code errors. Some of these sites may know this and take advantage of your vulnerability. They won't be able to do anything to your router or computer dns tables if you just change the default admin password of your router. Just do it. JUST DO IT.
