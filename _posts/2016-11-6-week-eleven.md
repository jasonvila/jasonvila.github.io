On the topic of CS373.

Core Questions:

~~ What did you do this past week? ~~

This past week has been completely packed with projects, assignments, tests, and lectures. As tough as this week has been, it did feel very managable (which I didn't really expect). I spent the majority of this week's free time on the project, gathering and massaging the data for the project as well as assisting other members in their tasks. I felt fairly accomplished after completing my project objectives, but that was at a cost of less time spent on the readings and focusing in lecture.


~~ What is in your way? ~~

It seems like a recurring theme this semester is my outside obligations and the fact that all of my classes like to make their due dates at the same time. Its been nice having a week off, but thats always leading to a hell week. If I spent less time leaving town and in organization meetings, and more time spent on assisting my teammates and finishing the readings, I think I would be doing better in this class.



~~ What will you do next week? ~~

Next week wil mostly comprise of working on the final project (only a couple of weeks left), finishing the final reading assignments, and attending lecture. There isn't a lot of diversity between each week, but this class sure does keep me busy. Perhaps this week will be primarily focused on producing the search engine apis for the search page of our project. 



~~ My experiences with CS373 this week: ~~

This week included many stressful moments, many of which composed of a semi miniature break down. I was happy with my accomplishments this week, especially with the data collection and massaging. I enjoyed the lectures, especially in the manner that we're approaching data management with Python and SQL. I've down independent studies in SQL, relational, and non-relational data storages/databases, but its been a while since I've gone over this kind of material. Its nice to learn about these topics through Downing's style of teaching.



~~ My reactions to CS373 material this week: ~~

I was slightly baffled at the power of SQL, but nonetheless, I didn't feel completely off guard or surprised by SQL's behavior (compared to Python's behavior). I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Downing's comments and approach to teaching SQL, so it was a nice refresher.



~~ Tip of the Week: ~~

There is a fascinating tool out there called Elastic Search that not only serves as a data storage (Elastic Cloud clusters), but also makes searching data much faster. Many companies have been switching to or testing out elastic search because of the features it offers. Not only does it provide optimized searches, but it gives the programmers the ability to monitor and watch statistics on the data sent, stored, and received. Its incredibly effect if you want to build clustered data storages, and so many nodejs applications prefer to use Elastic Search and Elastic Cloud as their data storage.
