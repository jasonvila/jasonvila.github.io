On the topic of CS373.

Core Questions:

~~ What did you do this past week? ~~

This past week has been unusually calmer than most weeks, but its still busy with the SWE project #3. We only have to create a dozen or so static pages, but the scraping is perhaps the most time consuming parts of this. In order to have a realistic site, we have to find accurate and reliable data that fulfills the quota amount we're looking for. Well... it turns out that there are a lot of APIs available, however, registering for the keys and compiling/massaging all of the data we're querying for is becoming a heavy bottle neck.



~~ What is in your way? ~~

I wasn't terribly side swiped by outside obligations this week, but I still felt that there were many more wasteful distractions this week (such as getting more rest) as the prior weeks. Also, the projects and assignmnets in the other classes have certainly taken a toll on my committment towards this course.



~~ What will you do next week? ~~

This next week will primarily be focused on finishing the SWE project #3, since its due on Thursday, October 17th. While the project doesn't seem like an impossible task, finalizing the data and polishing the product will probably cause more of an urgency than there should be. Attending class, reviewing the material, and finishing the reading assignments, of course, will also be key aspects of my busy work this upcoming.



~~ My experiences with CS373 this week: ~~

This week has been a delightful experience. I'm very excited that we are now starting the projects that the course was mean't for. The material we covered (decorators) are definitely a lot more interesting and useful than I thought. I was always curious about what decorators are and the purpose of annotations in the code (such as beans in Java Spring framework).



~~ My reactions to CS373 material this week: ~~

My reactions to the material this week is definitely enthusiastic and excited. The material we learned this week is newer than usual, and the projects we're taking on are certainly in a different category of "team work" based projects. As much as I love working on projects on my own, I especially love spending time on working on a team based project. The rest of the semester should be interesting for sure.



~~ Tip of the Week: ~~

My tip of the week has to do with using beans on Java Spring framework based applications. Be sure to always take advantage of the bean annotations in the code, it saves so much time and makes the code so much more intuitive. Often times tracing what an API or a function does can be way too time consuming, so having a standard set of bean annotations or decorators can help ease the pain of code ambiguity.
